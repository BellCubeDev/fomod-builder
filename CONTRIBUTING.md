# Contributing to the Fomod Builder

I'm always open to any contributions you may have. If you're looking to contribute but don't know what to do, there are some important ways you can help out:

### Testing & Reporting Bugs

I can't humanly test every scenario. Naturally, people (like you!) are going to find bugs. If you do find one, please [report it](/BellCubeDev/fomod-builder/issues/new) with as much detail as you can. If you can reproduce it, that's even better. If you can't reproduce it, that's okay tooâ€”report it anyway and we'll see what we can do.

### Translation

I speak a grand total of one language. If you'd like to help translate the Fomod Builder into a language you know, take a look at [strings.ts](src/app/components/strings.ts) and see if you're able to help out!

The method of localization I've implemented assumes nothing about the languages it uses. I give you the raw values you need to come up with your own translation, regardless of how other languages handle it.

### Feature Requests & User Feedback

More ideas, more better! If you have a suggestion that you think might help make the Fomod Builder more usable, [add an issue](/BellCubeDev/fomod-builder/issues/new) and I'll gladly take a look!

If you've found something confusing when working with Fomod installers or the builder, if you've found a discrepancy between how mod managers present or handle certain options, or even if you just want to say thanks, I'd love to hear from you! [Add an issue](/BellCubeDev/fomod-builder/issues/new) or [start a discussion](/BellCubeDev/fomod-builder/discussions/new) and let me know what you think!

### Direct Contributions

If you're familiar (or willing to get familiar) with the project structure and/or React and/or Next.js, you're always welcome to submit a pull request directly. I'll review it and see where it goes from there! Anything is fair game, especially if you want to address [an existing issue](/BellCubeDev/fomod-builder/issues)!
